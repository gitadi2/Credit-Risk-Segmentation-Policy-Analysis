# Credit Risk Segmentation & Policy Impact Analysis #

## Overview
This project analyzes loan application data to assess credit risk and evaluate the impact of approval policies. The focus is on creating explainable risk segments, validating data quality using SQL, and translating insights into business decisions through dashboards.

The project is designed to reflect real-world banking and fintech analytics workflows rather than purely academic modeling.


## Objective
- Segment loan applicants based on credit risk
- Design a practical approval policy
- Measure the impact of the policy on approval and default rates


## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook


## Key Work Done
- Cleaned and validated loan data to ensure accuracy and consistency
- Engineered risk-related features such as loan-to-income ratio, credit score bands, and debt-to-income metrics
- Implemented SQL-based data quality checks using staging and final tables
- Designed a rule-based credit risk segmentation framework
- Evaluated an approval policy by comparing approval and default rates before and after policy application
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to communicate insights clearly to stakeholders


## Data Note
Due to file size constraints, raw and processed datasets are not included in this repository.The analysis pipeline assumes access to the original loan dataset and
reproduces all results through documented preprocessing, SQL validation, and feature engineering steps.

## Outcome
The analysis provides a clear understanding of applicant risk distribution and demonstrates how data-driven policies can reduce default risk while maintaining approval coverage. The dashboard enables easy interpretation of risk and policy impact for business users.
