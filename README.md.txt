***  Credit Risk Segmentation & Loan Policy Impact Analysis ***

##  Overview
This project analyzes loan applicant data to assess credit risk, segment customers into Low, Medium, and High Risk groups, and evaluate the impact of a risk-based loan approval policy. The goal is to reduce default risk while maintaining a high approval rate.



##  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- GitHub



##  Methodology
- Cleaned and prepared financial and credit data
- Engineered features such as Loan-to-Income Ratio and Credit Score Bands
- Built a weighted risk scoring model using affordability and credit metrics
- Segmented applicants into risk categories and validated using default rates
- Simulated a risk-based loan approval policy and measured business impact



##  Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:
- Approval Rate
- Baseline vs Policy Default Rates
- Risk Reduction
- Customer Distribution by Risk Segment
- Approval Comparison (Baseline vs Policy)


## Key Results
- Approval Rate (After Policy): ~88.9%
- Default Rate Reduction: ~3%
- Default rates increase consistently from Low to High Risk



## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end credit risk analytics workflow combining data analysis, risk segmentation, policy simulation, and business-focused visualization, similar to real-world banking and finance use cases.
